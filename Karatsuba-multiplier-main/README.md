# Karatsuba-multiplier
a 256-bit karatsuba multiplier implemented using booth multiplier in VHDL
this code uses a recursive algorithm and booth multiplier to implement karatsuba multiplier. 
booth multiplier is a 32 bit multiplier which is the extended to 64,128 and 256 bit karatsuba multipier
this project takes time to simulate and is not capcapable of connection to remote FPGA
